Fractionator is an English learning tool for English language learners. 
Fractionator can create a word list sorted from least common words to most common 
words form input text so you can learn the vocabulary of a book or a movie ahead 
without spoilers and have a not-interrupted-by-dictionary reading or watching 
experiments.

To use Fractionator, click [Paste Text] button, then paste your input text or 
click [Choose File] button, choose a text file (.txt), or a subtitle file (.srt). 
Finally, click [Fractionate] button to see the fractionating result. Try It now 
by clicking the [Demo] button to see the fractionating result of some example text. 

Fractionator is free software, all text is processed locally on your browser 
without been uploaded to any servers.
